Blind Swordsman

[Verse 1: Jakal]
What's your life like?
Ceilings with the propane
I don't wanna call, have to see you with them snow stains
I don't wanna fall, don't wanna see you sniffing cocaine
Demons all around, on the stage I had to go away
Told them that I have my back, and I got my front
I been in the back, chilling with my (Yesssss)
You've been feelin lack, generate it once
I can't go outside, on the screen tryna stunt
Things get peaceful when you rest inside your statement
I've been reading all these books, I'm [?]
If I ever do the crime, I write no statements
I see you filled with hatе man, and now you on the pavement
Blood laying whеre you lived
I be sad to see a human dead because they had so much more to give
Love to all my people who ain't walked around with [?]
(walked around with [?])
(yeah)
(they ain't walk around with fear)
(yeah)
(they ain't walk around with [?])
(im free)
Hold hands with yourself, give yourself love
I can hear you gone when you talk, give yourself hugs
Niggas get to talkin' but ain't walking, you a scared thug
Sitting on the staircase, tryna get your head straight
I don't wanna fear me
(i don't wanna be scared of myself)
No I don't wanna fear me
(but they never will know)
No I don't wanna fear me
I can see it clearly
Residence and residues wanna do me like Achilles
I've been finding clues like I'm blues can you see me?
(can you see me?)
Death and taxes is the only thing that's guaranteed
No it's not cuz I've been loving every day with me
The only thing that's guaranteed is what I guarantee
And I guarantee that I'm gon' be that nigga and thats a guarantee
(yeah I put that shit on my fucking life nigga, the only one I got)
Populous population
They obsessed with fame while they waitin' at the station
What you really doing, is you really your occupation?
Everything I'm doing, I've been doin' it with patience and with love
As I strive, as these tears roll down my eyes
I can't live my life acting like I won't die
Everything I'm doing, I've been doin' it with closed eyes, cuz I know everything I see is really seen from inside it's inside (inside inside inside)
(sensations)
(purely sensations)
(from inside, it's inside)
(Thank you Lil B)
(from inside it's inside)
