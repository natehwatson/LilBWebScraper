Dragons Mist

Come fly with me
Come fly with me
Universal struggle of the truth is
The king's crown's on my head But I never battled for the throne
Taking him blood Then I sent you home
No more playing in the arena
Gladiator sports get your head chopped off before court
Hear you hear you
I summon the based god
We behold the creation dark energy
But not Satan
Looks black but not evil
Darkness misunderstood by the people
Don't be afraid daytimе people still dying
What's the diffеrence?
Nighttime my body armor
Reflecting off the sea
Spirit potions
The book of flame rises
Growing out of the sand
Plans bloom on the driest land I consume
Give back to the earth because it's helping you
I'm a based god
The energy shifts
But I remain the same
Gotta keep it real The book of flame
Decompose offering myself
When I go become a tree in the afterlife
Tall as a bow Sad to say free two baby 2024
But it's free Rocky bitch till I'm old
The world is full of greed Birds looking around to feed
The seeds fall on the ground By the leaves
Wishing all my homies the best life
Was the love real? Broken home broke your spirit
Pieces of glass on the ground Like a puzzle this is more than lyrics
Pick yourself up we more than just street punks
The love is right here
And you can double up
It's hard for me to leave or forgive
Never wanted your lifestyle
Cause my style is it
I can't have everything so why would I trip?
I'ma fall back into the dragon's mist
Its Lil B
Yes
