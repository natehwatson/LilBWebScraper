Flipping Birds

[Chorus]
I’m gon get these racks
I’m gon flip these packs
I’m gon sell a sack
I’m gon make it back
I’m gon flip these birds
Post up on the curb
My dope [swinging?] swerve
(yea)
I’m gon get these racks
I’m gon flip these packs
I’m gon sell a sack
I’m gon make it back
I’m gon flip these birds
Post up on the curb
My dope [swinging?] swerve

[Verse 1]
How can you judge me? On a rainy day
Reflected on my life, thankful I can breathe today
How do I forgive? How do I forget?
I ain’t even legit, they tellin’ me to be legit
But I'm with this shit, pilling money on top
You know I'm taking risks, workin’ out a trip
Baggin’ up these zips
When you take four or five trips you doin’ six
I never snitch
It’s the code
I won’t sell my soul
Some people get that fake gold
What’s real is real
It’s all on me
5o’clock drop is the recipe
But imma bring you all the way to 7th street
I wasn’t the type to run deep
Cuz I'm too unique, I'm too unique
My bike is a bus
We on the street (we on the street)
