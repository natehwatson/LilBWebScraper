I Feel Like Im Burning

Any of them opinions and shit like that
I don't really give a fuck
When you talk about Lil B, you talk about the bass god
You talk about legends, classics, top status
Someone that changed the game forever
Stealing this ish, playing this, you hear me? Not stopping
So I understand who you talking to
I traveled so much, they got a car backcourt
Before hard drives, I still had a passport
The gun lit plastic, she be like, "What's that for?"
Bitch you will get lit up and blasted off
My life is like a movie, I fast forward
You do everything for money cause you's a whore
I don't do whack shit, bitch, shut your mouth faggot
I push more dope than an ounce, faggot
She call me a bitch, I'm like, "So what?"
Put a dress on and you get that cold cut
I be like, "So what?" You get the whole blunt
I don't give a fuck, you know this shit is sold up
I cry every night with no tears
Sword on my hand cause I got no fear
Bass world records, every year
Real bass music, it just comes from the spirit
You know, one take Jake type shit
Them opinions about that Lil B music, keep it to yourself
All we do is classics, you feel me?
