Im a Furry

[Intro]
Sittin' at the top
Yeah (Woo)
Top floor of the castle

[Chorus]
I'm the king of the castle
All my youngins is animals
Don't run up, we'll grab you (Shoo, shoo)
All my youngins is animals
I'm a dog, you a mammal
I'm a frog, I ramble
All my youngins is animals (Woo, woo)

[Verse 1]
Bring the choppa, come out
Please come open the gate
All these swords in yo' face
All my youngins gon' hate
And we swingin' in the trees
Put your body on a leash
Thank you BasedGod, please help me, I'ma run it up
Everybody lit in the castle, I'ma fuck it up
My best friend look like Harry Potter, put a spell on ya'
57 bitches, and they look like Mrs. America (Let’s Go!)
