Still Walking

[Intro]
(Keyboard made it)
Keyboard, what up?

[Verse]
[?] that's payback
I’m in Ohio so I know my money coming way back
I found a connect and then I lost him, that's a normal remix
This shit get so exhausting
And how you a thug but you ain't did no street shit?
Selling birds like Ziggler the Wiggler
Poppin’ these pills, yeah, I'm off these jiggers
Foes be mad that they can't fuck with us
All these girls wanna come and have some fun
The sound that you heard was the *shh* from a drum
Drunk off this liquor that came out the thirties
Before alcohol was legal like I'm Beanie Sigel
Irish connection, my brothеr from Ireland
Take a trip down to Italy becausе I'm the fireman
I feel like Lil Wayne, nose full of [?], bitch
Fuck what you heard, I'm not racing
We in different lanes, our cars not the same
I might take a walk or something because I can
I'm the fuckin' man, my heart full of love
At the same time it’s pain, I see how they feeling
We want the same thing
Gratitude my attitude, gotta change for the better
I still walk the world for these blessings
It’s Lil B for Lil Boss, man, I gotta get it
Let's go
