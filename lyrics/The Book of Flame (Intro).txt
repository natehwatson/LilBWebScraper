The Book of Flame (Intro)

Breakfast, lunch and dinner, I appreciate it
This is good, right?
Open up the doors to life, not suicide, we not losing
Because the love is in the music
Non -literate but very wise. Who are you?
The darkest shades to conceal my eyes
The breath of fire burns deep
Profound ignorance, drunk off presumptions
East Oakland is like that for a reason
Rock bridges like that for a reason

Lies are evil, eyes are evil
Looked over the seat, pushed it on the others to live it out Watching life through clouded frames
As long as we know, Darwin can never understand my struggle and my pain
Is that the problem?
Assuming, studying, question everyone and everything
They working in the system, how are they going to change it? Why would the majority want to change it when it benefits them?
We look at the past, you can cover it up and just grin

Point the finger, just destroy you with a smile and live in comfort and tell they self, they did it to themselves
Evil spirit, need to be civilized
Eurocentric, moving in circles like a roundabout
Civilization was never civil, caring
Caring's never been civil, except caring civil
And even then that's another human that plays the middle
No disrespect
Divided and conquered and lied to
It's time to remind you, the uncomfortable truths
Uncover the minds in the booth
Uncover the false theories and walk upright
Understanding the system is a fight. It's never ending
The bravest thing to do is go against the system
Not the people, but the system
We are the people
We are the people
Lots of propaganda from then until now
A comfortable history shows a unibrow
Stretching across the face of the globe. Fair and unfair
A pig screams, a person screams
What's the difference?
Black people scream, then the music streams
One sided theory to justify those things
Acting like my friend, it's natural for them to traumatize
This is nothing but a farm with humans in the barn
People on the lawn
The book of flames standing strong
This is nothing but a farm with humans in the barn
And people on the lawn
It's the book of flames
