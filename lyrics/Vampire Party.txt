Vampire Party

[Intro]
I know Lil B
I know the Based God

[Chorus]
Vampire Party, It's a Vampire Party
Vampire Party, It's a Vampire Party
Vampire Party, It's a Vampire Party
Vampire Party, It's a Vampire Party
Argh!
Vampire Party
Vampire Party
Vampire Party
Vampire Party

[Verse]
When it turn night, turn the [?] to the party
I got Blood in my Mouth, i got mud in the party
And we often Vampires and we love to get it started
When the Clock strikes one, I spread my wings
Everything is not what it seems
I flew her to the party, and lived in the trends
I'mma bite the neck, i'mma make him scream
Wе all some vampires, and we all got wings

[Chorus]
Vampirе Party, It's a Vampire Party
Vampire Party, It's a Vampire Party
Vampire Party, It's a Vampire Party
Vampire Party, It's a Vampire Party
Argh!
Vampire Party
Vampire Party
Vampire Party
Vampire Party
